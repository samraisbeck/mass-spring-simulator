# Installation

**Need Python 2.7**

Also make sure you set your system environment variables (can search for this in
the start menu) are set up so that Python27 and Python27\Scripts are part of your
path (so you can use pip). Usually Python27 installs by default in the main directory
so it might just be C:\Python27.

`pip install pygame` for the simulation

`pip install pyside` for the GUI

`pip install matplotlib` for the plot in the GUI

`pip install numpy` for numerical operations (probably not necessary)

These can be automatically installed using the given `requirements.txt` (i.e. `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
